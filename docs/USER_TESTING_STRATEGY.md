## Emergency Debugging Steps

If you encounter critical issues:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Open development tools
   - Look for red error messages
   - Note any network failures

2. **Verify Data Flow:**
   - Database ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Facade ‚Üí Store ‚Üí UI
   - Check data shape at each step

3. **Test Performance:**
   - Use device performance monitor
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify network request timing

4. **Isolate the Issue:**
   - Test on different devices
   - Try with different data sets
   - Test with/without network

Remember: The goal is to catch major issues before Day 14 testing, not to achieve perfection. Focus on critical user flows and basic functionality first.
